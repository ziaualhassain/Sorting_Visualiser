“Sorting Algorithms Visualiser” is a web app where we can compare how actually each sorting algorithm works. Sorting is an important part in programming as well as in reallife as it is easier and faster to locate items in a sorted order rather than unsorted.These algorithms have direct applications in searching, organizing, data structures and more.. <br>



We have multiple sorting algorithms like Bubble sort, Selection sort, Insertion sort, Quick sort. But often we fail to understand the core idea of a particular algorithm maybe because we are unable to visualize how they work. So the most important thing to understand about these algorithms is visualization. <br>



The Web application will be developed using the HTML,CSS and JavaScript.The application user interface was able to visualize the sorting process using various colors and denote the status of the elements in the array. It includes features to select the size of the data(The number of elements present in the array), visualization speed, sorting algorithm of their choice present in the UI.
